## About

Jasper9 is a 2D-in-3D role-playing game (RPG) built with Unity and designed for WebGL deployment. The game integrates seamlessly into a React frontend with a Supabase backend for user accounts and data management.

## Project Overview

This repository contains documentation and resources for developing the Jasper9 game, focusing on modular Unity WebGL components and React integration.

### Key Technologies

- **Unity Engine**: Core game development platform (v6000.0.45f1)
- **WebGL**: Export target for browser compatibility
- **React**: Frontend framework for game embedding and UI
- **Supabase**: Backend for user authentication and data storage

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [`/docs`](docs/) directory:

- [Introduction](docs/Introduction.md): Overview of designing Unity WebGL components for RPGs
- [Unity Components](docs/UnityComponents.md): Key components for the Jasper9 game
- [Modular Development](docs/ModularDevelopment.md): Strategies for modular game design with WebGL
- [Project Structure](docs/ProjectStructure.md): Recommended folder organization
- [React Integration](docs/ReactIntegration.md): Embedding Unity WebGL in React applications
- [Best Practices](docs/BestPractices.md): Performance optimization and AI NPC management

## Development Workflow

The Jasper9 project follows these development principles:

1. **Modular Development**: Components are designed for reusability and efficient WebGL builds
2. **Prefab-Based Architecture**: Game elements are created as prefabs for consistency
3. **Optimized for Web**: All assets and scripts are optimized for web performance
4. **React Integration**: The game is designed to be embedded in a React application
5. **Security-First**: Credentials are managed securely following best practices

## Installation & Setup

Detailed setup instructions for both development and deployment will be added as the project progresses.

### Credentials Management

This project uses environment variables for secure credential storage. Security documentation is maintained separately and not included in this repository for security reasons. Contact the project maintainer for access to security documentation.
