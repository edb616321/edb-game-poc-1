# Best Practices for WebGL RPG Development

Here are some best practices and considerations specific to this setup – a Unity WebGL RPG with AI NPCs and React integration:

## WebGL Performance Optimization

Running in a browser means performance is at a premium. You should optimize the game much like you would for a mobile platform. Key tips include:

- **Simplify Graphics:** Favor simpler 3D models and 2D sprites over very high-poly 3D models. One source explicitly advises using 2D or very simple 3D models for WebGL games. High-detail assets not only increase load times but can slow the GPU in WebGL (which, though using hardware acceleration, might not handle as many draw calls or complex shaders as a native app would).

- **Minimize Draw Calls:** Unity WebGL, like any platform, can choke on too many draw calls. The CPU overhead in issuing WebGL draw calls is higher than native. Use techniques like GPU instancing for repeated objects and static/dynamic batching for meshes. Combine meshes or sprites where possible (Sprite Atlas for many sprites will reduce draw calls, and Unity UI also benefits from using atlases for UI images).

- **Use Efficient Shaders/Materials:** Avoid heavy shader effects that aren't WebGL friendly. For example, complex post-processing or real-time shadows might be too slow on WebGL, especially on integrated GPUs. The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is recommended for WebGL because it's optimized for performance (especially on mobile browsers). URP's Forward Renderer with simplified settings is ideal; definitely avoid the HDRP (it won't even support WebGL fully).

- **Optimize Physics:** If your game uses physics, be mindful that the physics engine runs on the main thread. Keep the number of rigidbodies and colliders manageable. For example, having hundreds of physics objects might be too slow. Use simpler colliders (capsules, spheres) instead of mesh colliders when possible. If certain interactions can be turned off when not needed (e.g., NPC ragdolls or rigidbodies can be disabled when far away), do so to save processing.

- **Memory and Garbage Collection:** WebGL uses a managed heap for Unity's IL2CPP runtime. Big spikes in memory or frequent allocations can trigger garbage collection pauses which on WebGL might be noticeable (as all is single-threaded). To mitigate this, pool objects instead of constantly instantiating/destroying, reuse lists or other allocations in scripts, and keep an eye on the memory footprint. You might have to tune the WebGL heap size in Player Settings – too low and you'll crash on allocation, too high and you waste browser memory.

- **Quality Settings:** Unity allows you to have specific Quality settings per platform. Set up a WebGL quality profile that turns off expensive effects: limit shadows, reduce texture resolution (there's a global texture mipmap limit per quality), turn off anti-aliasing if not needed, etc. The game should still look good, but focus on stable performance over visual extravagance for WebGL.

- **Audio Considerations:** Audio in WebGL is handled via the Web Audio API. Unity's documentation notes that only core audio features are supported and some things behave differently. Keep audio clip sizes reasonable and compression on (Decompress on load might fix some iOS issues, but that increases memory usage; you may need to experiment). Also, be aware that browsers often require a user interaction to start audio (Unity's WebGL template usually handles this by waiting for a click before unmuting).

- **Testing on Multiple Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc., all perform differently. For example, Firefox historically had better asm.js performance, and Safari (on iOS especially) has some WebGL quirks. Test your game on all target browsers and devices. If mobile web is important, definitely test on actual phones early – you might discover you need to scale back some effects or that certain UI needs tweaking for touch.

- **Set Exceptions Off:** In Player Settings for WebGL, set Exception Support to none or explicit only. Full exceptions support can greatly bloat the build and slow down performance. Unity's advice for best performance is to disable full exception support (but remember this means you get less info if something crashes in release build).

- **Use "Fastest" Optimization:** In Build Settings, use the "Fastest" code optimization for WebGL build. This will prioritize speed over build size. Given that we can compress builds, a slightly larger wasm is fine if it runs faster.

- **Profiling:** Use the Unity Profiler in WebGL builds (with autoconnect, since you can't attach after the fact). Profile early to catch any slowdowns in AI, rendering, etc., and optimize those scripts or assets.

By following these optimizations, you'll treat the WebGL game akin to a mobile game from a performance perspective. Unity WebGL can perform well if you stay within reasonable limits (one developer noted it's fine as long as you treat it like a 2015-era mobile device in capability). In practice, an RPG with moderate graphics and a few dozen on-screen characters can run smoothly if designed with these guidelines.

## AI NPC Runtime Interaction Handling

Having AI-driven NPCs adds a lot of life to an RPG, but also some CPU burden. Here's how to manage AI interactions efficiently at runtime, especially in the WebGL context:

- **Use Efficient AI Logic:** As mentioned, a Finite State Machine (FSM) or Behavior Tree can structure NPC behavior. The key is to ensure that in each frame, the work an NPC AI does is minimal. For example, if an NPC is in an "idle" state, it might not need to run any code each frame except a cheap check (like a random chance to play an idle animation or a check if the player is near). Heavy computations (pathfinding, complex decisions) should happen only when necessary (e.g., when switching state or at intervals).

- **Spread Out AI Updates:** If you have many NPCs, you don't need to update all their AI logic every single frame. You can stagger their updates. For instance, update 1/3 of the NPCs each frame (so each updates at 20 FPS if you have 60 FPS frame rate). This can be done by simple techniques like only calling their update logic when `(Time.frameCount + npcId) % 3 == 0` or using Unity's `InvokeRepeating` with different start delays. This reduces CPU load spikes from AI.

- **NavMesh and Pathfinding:** Unity's NavMeshAgents are pretty optimized (written in C++), but they can still cost CPU, especially if you have dozens active. Best practices include: disabling NavMeshAgent on NPCs that are idle/stationary and won't move soon, or setting their update rate lower. You can also adjust the avoidance quality or turn off avoidance if it's not needed (NPCs can sometimes overlap a bit if that's acceptable). In an RPG, you rarely need more than, say, 10-20 active moving NPCs at once around the player. If your design calls for crowds, you may need to simplify crowd AI (e.g., only a few "active" AI, others are dummy or animated only).

- **Deactivate Distant NPCs:** If the player moves through a world and leaves NPCs behind, consider deactivating or despawning NPCs that are far away and not currently relevant. For example, only NPCs within, say, 50 units of the player remain active; others could be disabled (their GameObject turned off or a pool stores them). This way, you could have a large world with many NPCs, but only a subset are doing AI at any time. Just make sure to handle when the player comes back near them (either re-activate or respawn them, perhaps with their last known state).

- **Limit Heavy AI Calculations:** Avoid using very heavy algorithms on the client side. For instance, if you considered using a complex pathfinding outside of NavMesh, or a vision system that casts lots of rays for NPC sight – try to find a cheaper alternative. Maybe use trigger colliders for vision (e.g., an NPC has a capsule trigger as "vision range" – much cheaper than doing a physics raycast every frame for each NPC's line of sight).

- **Animation vs Logic:** Sometimes NPC "AI" can be partly just animations. For example, a wandering NPC could simply have a pre-defined patrol path or use an animation to move them along a route, rather than dynamically deciding where to go each time. This reduces CPU logic (trading it for a bit of precomputation or design time setup).

- **Use Profiling to Find Bottlenecks:** In the Editor or development builds, use the Profiler to see where AI is spending time. You might find, for instance, that a certain script's Update() is being called too often. Maybe an NPC does a heavy check every frame that could be done every second instead. Optimize those once identified.

- **Consider External AI Services (if applicable):** Since the question mentions AI-driven NPCs, if this implies something like using machine learning or external AI (for dialogue or behavior), consider offloading that. For example, if NPC dialogue is powered by an AI model (like ChatGPT-style responses), you might call a cloud function or service (possibly via Supabase functions or other API) rather than running a heavy model in Unity. That means a network call during gameplay – design around the latency (maybe trigger the call when dialogue starts and show a "..." waiting indicator). This keeps the heavy AI computation off the client. But if "AI-driven" just means coded behavior, then this might not apply.

- **Concurrency and Asynchronous Calls:** If you do have to call out to backend (say to get NPC behavior or data), remember WebGL can't use threading easily. But you can use asynchronous patterns (Unity's `async/await` with UnityWebRequest, etc.). Just ensure the game doesn't freeze while waiting for a response. For example, if you click an NPC and it fetches dialogue from Supabase (maybe Supabase Edge Functions), have the NPC play a thinking animation while waiting and don't stall the main thread.

## Additional Best Practices and Considerations

- **Supabase and Networking:** Keep your network calls efficient. Batch calls if you can (Supabase allows RPC calls or bulk fetches). For instance, load all necessary player data in one request at game start rather than multiple round trips (one for inventory, one for stats, etc.). Also handle network errors gracefully – if the user loses connection, your game should detect that (perhaps via a timeout or Supabase real-time notifies) and inform the player or attempt reconnection.

- **Saving Progress:** Decide when the game saves to the backend. Since an online RPG in WebGL can't write to local disk easily (there is PlayerPrefs and IndexedDB in the browser for small data, but anything persistent across devices should go to Supabase), you might auto-save when certain events happen (e.g., completed quest, or every X minutes). Be careful not to save too frequently (to avoid flooding the backend or causing lag).

- **WebGL Specific Input:** Remember that on WebGL, some things differ, e.g., no hardware cursor lock without user interaction, and no universal file access. If your RPG has keybindings, ensure the default keys don't conflict with browser shortcuts. If you need text input (say to name a character), Unity UI input fields should work, but on some browsers/mobile you might hit issues – test them.

- **Optimize WebGL Load Time:** RPGs can have lots of assets. Use Unity's **Splash Screen** or a custom loading screen to keep the user informed while loading. Unity WebGL will show a default progress bar; you can customize that in templates or using the library. Also, as mentioned, Addressables to split initial download can help. Texture compression is your friend – use ASTC/ETC for mobile targets, and Unity will include DXT for desktop by default. Compressed textures and audio massively reduce download size and memory.

- **Testing Memory Footprint:** Web browsers have limits on memory (especially 32-bit address space for wasm on some). Unity by default might allocate a few hundred MB heap. If your game grows, watch the memory in the browser task manager. If you approach 1-2GB, that's dangerous for crashes. Optimize assets (downsize textures if you see high memory usage, etc.).

- **Community Resources:** Leverage community examples of similar setups. For instance, if you're unsure how to handle login flow between React and Unity, search for examples. There are also frameworks and SDKs (like PlayFab, etc.) but since you chose Supabase, focus on that.

By adhering to these best practices, you will set a strong foundation for your Unity WebGL RPG project. You'll have a clean, modular project structure, a game that runs efficiently in the browser, and a seamless integration with your React front end and Supabase backend. Good luck with your development, and enjoy the process of bringing your 2D-in-3D RPG world to life!
